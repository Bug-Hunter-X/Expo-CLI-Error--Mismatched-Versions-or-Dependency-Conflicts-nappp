The solution involves carefully examining your `package.json` file.  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify conflicting dependencies. If you encounter peer dependency problems, prioritize resolving those first. Update your packages to their latest compatible versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. If updating causes further issues, consider downgrading some packages to versions known to work well together. If the problem persists, checking the Expo CLI's documentation for any known compatibility issues with specific package versions may be helpful.  If a particular package is causing issues, you may need to consult its documentation for assistance. Sometimes, simply deleting your `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages using `npm install` or `yarn install` resolves transient issues.
